# Homework 1

This homework is about autograd and gentle introduction to Catalyst framework.
Engine part is almost copied from Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd repo](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).
Nevertheless you should implement some operators by yourself.

[] You should start from `micrograd/engine.py` - implement backend
[] `micrograd/nn.py` - implement PyTorch-like frontend
[] `micrograd/optim.py` - implement optimizer
[] `test_nn.ipynb` - train small network on a toy dataset

Good luck!
